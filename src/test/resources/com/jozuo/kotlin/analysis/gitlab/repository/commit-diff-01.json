Spectron のインストール\n-\n-`npm install spectron --save-dev`\n-\n-もしくは\n-\n-`yarn add spectron --dev`\n-\n-\n-2. テストコードの記述\n-\n-Spectron による Electron アプリケーションの起動は、以下のように記述します。\n-\n-```spectron.js\n-const Application = require('spectron').Application;\n-const path = require('path');\n-const assert = require('assert');\n-\n-// Windows の場合、.cmd 拡張子をつける\n-const isWin = process.platform === 'win32';\n-const ext = isWin ? '.cmd' : '';\n-\n-const electronPath = require('electron');\n-\n-// ビルド済みの状態でテストする場合\n-const appPath = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'Electron アプリケーション(.exe)のパス')\n-\n-// 未ビルドの状態でテストする場合\n-const appPath = path.join(__dirname, '..'); // electron-main.js のあるディレクトリ\n-\n-\n-app.start().then(function () {\n-  // ウィンドウの表示状態を取得する\n-  return app.browserWindow.isVisible();\n-}).then(function (isVisible) {\n-  // ウィンドウが表示されているか\n-  assert.equal(isVisible, true);\n-}).then(function () {\n-  // ウィンドウのタイトルを取得する\n-  return app.client.getTitle();\n-}).then(function (title) {\n-  // ウィンドウのタイトルが\"My App\"であるか\n-  assert.equal(title, \"My App\")\n-}).then(function () {\n-  // 終わったらアプリケーションを停止する\n-  console.info(\"Test Success\");\n-  return app.stop();\n-}).catch(function (error) {\n-  // エラーをキャッチしたら、テストがエラーした旨のメッセージを表示する\n-  console.error(\"Test failed\", error.message);\n-  return app.stop();\n-});\n-```\n-\n-もし、`Application cannot be running` などと表示されてテストが実行されない場合、環境変数の `no_proxy` に `127.0.0.1,localhost` を設定してください。\n-\n-\n-ex. テストフレームワークを利用する場合\n-\n-Spectron は、各種テストフレームワークの中で利用することができます。例えば、mocha を利用する場合、Spectron の Promise チェーンの代わりに、以下のように記述します。\n-\n-```\n-describe('Test Example', function () {\n-    this.timeout(10000);\n-\n-\t// 各テスト前にアプリケーションを起動\n-    beforeEach(function () {\n-        return app.start();\n-    });\n-\n-\t// 各テスト後にアプリケーションが起動していれば終了させる\n-    afterEach(function () {\n-        if (app && app.isRunning())\n-            return app.stop();\n-    });\n-    \n-\n-    it('opens a window', function () {\n-        return app.client.waitUntilWindowLoaded()\n-            .getWindowCount().then((count) => {\n-                assert.equal(count, 2);\n-            });\n-    });\n-\n-    it('tests the title', function () {\n-        return app.client.waitUntilWindowLoaded()\n-            .getTitle().then((title) => {\n-                assert.equal(title, 'Hello World!');\n-            });\n-    });\n-});\n-```\n-\n-上記の記述の場合、テストに失敗すると `AssersionError` が羅列されます。気になる場合には `reject` 側のコードを記述してください。\n-\n-\n----\n-\n-## E2E テスト\n-\n-Selenium による自動 E2E テストの実行は、以下の手順に従って行ってください。\n-\n-Electron のバージョンが **1.4.15** であることを想定しています。動作しない場合、Chrome Driver のバージョンを適宜確認してください（資料なし）。適合する Chrome Driver のバージョンは、対象とするバージョンの Electron に対応する Spectron が保持している Chrome Driver のバージョンと同様であると思われます。\n-\n-\n-1. Chrome Driver サーバのダウンロード\n-\n-以下の URL から自身の環境用の Chrome Driver をダウンロードして起動します。\n-\n-Selenium テスト用 Chrome Driver\n-[2.25(https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.25/)\n-\n-\n-2. WebDriverJS のインストール\n-\n-`npm install --save-dev selenium-webdriver`\n-\n-もしくは\n-\n-`yarn add --dev selenium-webdriver`\n-\n-\n-3. テスト用アプリケーションのパッケージング\n-\n-現状、未ビルド状態でテストを行う方法は判明していません。自身の Electron アプリケーションをパッケージングし、実行可能な状態にしてください。\n-\n-\n-4. テストコードの記述\n-\n-Chrome Driver を介して Electron アプリケーションを起動するコードは次のとおりです。`.usingServer` の引数に割り当てられたポート番号は、起動した Chrome Driver サーバのものと同じものにしてください。\n-\n-```selenium.js\n-const webdriver = require('selenium-webdriver');\n-var driver = new webdriver.Builder()\n-  .usingServer('http://localhost:9515')\n-  .withCapabilities({\n-    chromeOptions: {\n-      binary: 'C:/Program Files/kobito/kobito.exe',\n-    }\n-  })\n-  .forBrowser('electron')\n-  .build();\n-```\n-\n-起動コード以降に、イベントの発火やテストを記述します。実行可能な API は[ここ](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/index.html) を参照してください。ただし、一部 API は利用できない可能性があります（拡張プラグインが不足？）。\n-\n-[参考1](http://qiita.com/hiroshitoda/items/288706978cd4c6df0f5f)\n-[参考2](http://qiita.com/edo_m18/items/ba7d8a95818e9c0552d9)\n-[jasmine でテスト](http://qiita.com/zaburo/items/55ebd5c4ea5b9e1f0416)\n-[mocha でテスト](http://bouyke.com/post/selenium-webdriver-and-mocha)\n\\ No newline at end of file\n",
